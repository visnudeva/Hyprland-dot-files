# Hyprland dot-files


Here are the config files i am using
- Hyprland (window manager)
- Hyprpaper (wallpaper) 
- Waybar (Wayland bar) with a custom mudule for Mullvad VPN which shows the location of the VPN and can be connected with a right click and disconnected with left click on the module.
- Swaylock (lockscreen) clean, blurred and transparent.
- Dmenu (network menu)
- Wofi (software launcher)


It is fully fonctionnnal but with unused code bits because i am still playing with it adding and removing things.
  
**Enjoy!**
