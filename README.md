# Hyprland dot-files

Here are the config files i am using for 
- hyprland 
- hyprpaper (wallpaper) 
- waybar with a custom mudule for Mullvad VPN which shows the location of the VPN and can be connected and disconnected from the bar
- swaylock (lockscreen)
- dmenu (network menu)
It is fully fonctionnnal but full of unused code bits because i am still playing with it adding and removing things.
Enjoy.
