Here are the softwares i installed and config files i am using

- Hyprpaper (wallpaper) 
- Waybar (wayland bar) with a custom mudule for Mullvad VPN which shows the location of the VPN and can be connected with a right click and disconnected with left click on the module.
- Swaylock-effects (lockscreen) clean, blurred and transparent.
- Wofi (software launcher)
- Mako (notification daemon)
- nm-connection-editor (network menu) accesible with a click on the wifi module of the waybar
- Pavucontrol (volume control mixer) accesible with a click on the volume module of the waybar
