# Hyprland dot-files

Here are the config files i am using for 
- Hyprland (window manager)
- Hyprpaper (wallpaper) 
- Waybar (Wayland bar) with a custom mudule for Mullvad VPN which shows the location of the VPN and can be connected and disconnected from the bar.
- Swaylock (lockscreen)
- Dmenu (network menu)
- Wofi (software launcher)
It is fully fonctionnnal but full of unused code bits because i am still playing with it adding and removing things.

##Enjoy.
