# dot-files

Here are the config files i am using for hyprland, hyprpaper (wallpaper), waybar and swaylock (lockscreen).
they are fully fonctionnnal but full of unused code bits because i am still playing with it adding and removing things.
All the folders go as they are into the .config folder of your system except the .swaylock folder wich is as the same level as the .config.
Enjoy.
