# Hyprland dot-files

My infrared theme with the wallpaper i made correponding to the theme,
the softwares i installed and the up to date config files i am using:

- Hyprland (window manager)
- Hyprpaper (wallpaper) 
- Waybar-hyprland (wayland bar) with a custom mudule for Mullvad VPN which shows the location of the VPN and can be connected with a right click and disconnected with left click on the module.
- Swaylock-effects (lockscreen) clean, blurred and transparent.
- Wofi (software launcher)
- Mako (notification daemon)
- nm-connection-editor (network menu) accesible with a click on the wifi module of the waybar
- Pavucontrol (volume control mixer) accesible with a click on the volume module of the waybar
- Blueman-manager (bluetooth manager) accesible with a click on the bluetooth module of the waybar
- Grim and slurp (screenshot) "Super+G" keyboard shortcut

It is fully fonctionnnal but with unused code bits because i am still playing with it adding and removing things.
  
**Enjoy!**
